      <h2>General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Projects</h2>
      <p>In August of 2021 I entered General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (SEI) program.  The 12 weeks of Deere-sponsored training included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Postgres, Git/GitHub, and Python.  Trainees completed four projects.  Each project increased in complexity.  Below are my SEI projects listed from the most recent (and complex) to the first.</p>

            <p>
                Written for guitar entusiasts, my fretboard application provides an easy way for aspiring guitarists to use the Circle of Fifths to improve their play without the rigor of learning songs.  When the user selects a musical key from a dropdown menu, the Circle highlights chords that work well in that key.  At the same time, chord diagrams are provided and two to four musical scales are provided.  The user can record his/her chord progressions and play them back while playing licks using the provided scales.

          This project is written in React. The application accesses four

          adult beverages. Drinks are retrieved either at random, by ingredient,
          in alphabetical lists, or via user-entered search. I partnered with a
          classmate on this project. Each of us developed features in our own
          Git branches and then merged and pushed code to our main repository on
          GitHub.

        <p>
          Written mostly in JavaScript, frivolous is trivia game. For this
          project I was mainly interested in working with arrays. I created
          three two-dimensional arrays for for trivia categories. Each element
          holds a question and an answer. There are only 15 questions per
          category. Each round, ten questions are randomly selected from the
          chosen category and placed in a questions array. The answer is
          randomly placed in one of four elements of an answers array. The other
          three elements of the answers array are pulled at random from the answer elements of the remaining 14 elements in the chosen category.

      <h3>The J8CM - My 8-bit computer model</h3>
      <div id="j8cm1">
          <img
            id="j8cmPanel"
            src="./img/j8cm_short2.gif"
            alt="j8cm front panel"
          />
          <div>
          <p>
            While working on my B.A. in Computer Science back in the 1990s, I
            took a class in computer architecture and design. As a project for
            that class, I wrote a computer simulator based on some of the
            machines I'd worked on in the late 70s and through the 80s. I named
            it, Jay's 8-bit Computer Model (J8CM). The program was written using
            Borland C 4.0 on a Microsoft Windows computer. In July, 2021 I
            decided to port the code (I saved it on a 3.5 inch floppy disk) to
            gcc on Linux.
          </p>
          <p>
            My YouTube channel contains several videos that demonstrate the program.  Source code and documentation are available on my GitHub page.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>J8CM Machine Language</h3>
      <img
        id="j8cm_inst_wd"
        src="./img/j8cm_inst_wd.png"
        alt="j8cm instruction word format"
      />
      <div id="j8cm2">
        <p>
          The J8CM is an accumulator-based model. As reflected by the
          instruction format, the J8CM contains 32 instructions, 4 addressing
          modes, and 2 general-purpose registers. Instructions and data can be
          loaded directly into the J8CM memory by setting the appropriate bits.
          Programs can be run completely, stepped through each instruction
          cycle, or at the fetch and execute level.
        </p>
        <img
          id="j8cm_mem_ed"

      <h3>J8CM Assembly Language</h3>
      <div id="j8cm3">
        <img
          id="j8cm_al"
          src="./img/j8cm_al_2.png"
          alt="j8cm assembly language"
        />
        <div>
        <p>
            The j8cm includes a compiler for writing assembly language code.  The compiler outputs several files.  During pass 1 the compiler produces a symbol file and an error log. In pass 2 the compiler produces an object file (.obj extender).  The object file is used when the operator wants to load the compiled output directly into the j8cm memory.  Another file type has the .ldr extender and is used to load the file into the j8cm loader.  The loader simulates a tape device.  The final file is a summary file that can be used to troubleshoot issues with the code.

            Documentation has been ported to the open document format (odt) and can be found on my GitHub repo at https://github.com/jaybabel/j8cm_documentation.

        <p>
          The first semester of my MBA program included a virtual course in
          Visual Basic for Microsoft Excel. My final project in that class was a
          program I could use to manage Little League baseball games. For me, it
          was important to give the boys opportunities to play different
          posisitions. I also wanted to give them approximately the same number
          of at-bats through the season while maintaining a batting order that
          produced the most runs.

          At John Deere I developed a few tools in VBA. When we retired a system
          for the Torrance office, I exported three tables from MS SQL and
          created an Excel program to search the tables and provide sales
          information from the old system.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Waterloo location, I created Excel tools to manage asset
          location standards and Active Directory group membership.
