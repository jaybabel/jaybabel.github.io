        <p>
          This project is written in React. The application accesses four
          different endpoints from www.cocktaildb.com to provide recipes for
          adult beverages. Drinks are retrieved either at random, by ingredient,
          in alphabetical lists, or via user-enterred search. I partnered with a
          classmate on this project. Each of us developed features in our own
          Git branches and then merged and pushed code to our main repository on
          GitHub.

        ><br />
        <p>
          Written mostly in JavaScript, frivolous is trivia game. For this
          project I was mainly interested in working with arrays. I created
          three two-dimensional arrays for for trivia categories. Each element
          holds a question and an answer. There are only 15 questions per
          category. Each round, ten questions are randomly selected from the
          chosen category and placed in a questions array. The answer is
          randomly placed in one of four elements of an answers array. The other
          three elements are pulled at random from the remaining 14 elements in
          the category.

            While working on my B.A. in Computer Science back in the 1990s, I
            took a class in computer architecture and design. As a project for
            that class, I wrote a computer simulator based on some of the
            machines I'd worked on in the late 70s and through the 80s. I named
            it, Jay's 8-bit Computer Model (J8CM). The program was written using
            Borland C 4.0 on a Microsoft Windows computer. In July, 2021 I
            decided to port the code (I saved it on a 3.5 inch floppy disk) to
            gcc on Linux.

      />
      <div id="j8cm2">
        <p>
          The J8CM is an accumulator-based model. As reflected by the
          instruction format, the J8CM contains 32 instructions, 4 addressing
          modes, and 2 general-purpose registers. Instructions and data can be
          loaded directly into the J8CM memory by setting the appropriate bits.
          Programs can be run completely, stepped through each instruction
          cycle, or at the fetch and execute level√ü.

          The first semester of my MBA program included a virtual course in
          Visual Basic for Microsoft Excel. My final project in that class was a
          program I could use to manage Little League baseball games. For me, it
          was important to give the boys opportunities to play different
          posisitions. I also wanted to give them approximately the same number
          of at-bats through the season while maintaining a batting order that
          produced the most runs.

          At John Deere I developed a few tools in VBA. When we retired a system
          for the Torrance office, I exported three tables from MS SQL and
          created an Excel program to search the tables and provide sales
          information from the old system.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Waterloo location, I created Excel tools to manage asset
          location standards and Active Directory group memebership.
