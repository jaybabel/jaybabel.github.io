            <p>While working on my B.A. in Computer Science back in the 1990s, I took a class in computer architecture and design.  As a project for that class, I wrote a computer simulator based on some of the machines I'd worked on in the late 70s and through the 80s.  I named it, Jay's 8-bit Computer Simulator (J8CM).  The program was written using Borland C 4.0 on a Microsoft Windows computer.  In July, 2021 I decided to port the code (I saved it on a 3.5 inch floppy disk) to gcc on Linux.</p>

        <div id="j8cm2">
                    <p>The J8CM is an accumulator-based model.  As reflected by the instruction format, the J8CM contains 32 instructions, 4 addressing modes, and 2 general-purpose registers.  Instructions and data can be loaded directly into the J8CM memory by setting the appropriate bits.  Programs can be run completely, stepped through each instruction cycle, or at the fetch and execute level√ü.</p>
